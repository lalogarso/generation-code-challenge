Generation Take-Home Coding Challenge - Lalo García Solution
=================================
Hi, I'm very happy, this days i learned many things of React
¡Is a awesome framework!

This is my solution, i'd like add more things like:

* Put the markers according the CP of stores
* Find and center the store when you click on the store of My favorite Stores

Of course is posible but the time is limited, i will continue attend
this issues.

Notes:

1.- I generated the position of the stores because the list had not that
information (all inner Mexico City). <br/>
2.- The list My Favorite Stores not allow repeated items.<br/>
3.- If you delete a store of My Favorite Stores you can add this store again.

### How do you start?

Clone the repo on your computer

Run
```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```
